# Selfage

## NPM packages

@selfage features a package family published on NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40selfage), focusing on web app and service development using TypeScript, based on popular tools such as [browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify), [uglify-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js), [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier), and [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express). All packages stress on static analysis such as type-safe APIs and metaprogramming.

Each package has its own documentation and it's fairly standalone, i.e. it's not closely coupled with other @selfage packages. Therefore you can only use what you need from @selfage packages without worrying about introducing the entire package family.

The following tutorials focuses on how to use @selfage packages together with other tools to build your website, assuming you already have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nodejs, NPM, and TypeScript.
